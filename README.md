7. Technology Stack
Technology	Purpose
React.js	Frontend Framework
Material UI	UI Components
Local Storage	Backend for storing user data
Vercel	Deployment


8. Backend Explanation
This project uses Local Storage instead of Firebase/MongoDB because:


# - The task is frontend-focused, and a full backend would be unnecessary overhead.
# - Using Local Storage keeps the implementation lightweight and easy to manage.
# - If scaling up, we could replace Local Storage with Firebase or a MongoDB + Express backend.
